# YouthApp Database Schema Overview

**GitHub Issue:** #1 - Describe Database Schema

This document outlines the initial version of the YouthApp relational database schema, which is implemented using
PostgreSQL. The system is designed to support a program where users complete educational activities organized into
paths, pins, and badges. All primary keys are sequential `INTEGER` IDs. Enums are handled in the application layer (
Java) rather than in the database.

> üîí All sensitive information (like credentials) is injected via environment variables.

## Schema Summary

The system supports:

- Multiple users with different roles (`USER`, `LEADER`, `ADMIN`, `SUPER_ADMIN`)
- Users belonging to a troop
- Two types of activities: standalone "paths" (ŒúŒøŒΩŒøœÄŒ±œÑŒπŒ±) and grouped "pin activities" (ŒîœÅŒ±œÉœÑŒ∑œÅŒπœåœÑŒ∑œÑŒµœÇ Œ†œÑœÖœáŒØŒøœÖ)
- Two types of pins: "normal" (Œ†œÑœÖœáŒØŒ±) and "special" (Œ†œÑœÖœáŒØŒ± ŒüŒ¥Œ∑Œ≥ŒπœÉŒºŒøœç) (mandatory for badges)
- Three progressive badges (ŒöŒøœÅœÖœÜŒ≠œÇ): Bronze, Silver, and Gold
- Full tracking of user progress through activities, pins, and badges
- Session management using external authentication tokens
